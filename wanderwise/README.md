## Chatbot Integration

This project includes an AI chatbot feature that can assist users with travel-related queries. The chatbot is integrated into the application through the `Chatbot` component located in `src/components/Chatbot.jsx`. 

### Usage

To use the chatbot, simply interact with the chat interface that appears on the screen. The chatbot utilizes an AI service for generating responses based on user input.

### AI Service

The AI service logic is encapsulated in `src/ai/chatbotService.js`, which handles API calls and processes responses from the AI model. Ensure that the necessary API keys and configurations are set up in this file for the chatbot to function correctly.
